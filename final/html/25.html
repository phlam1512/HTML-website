<p>Looking at our society as a whole, stereotypes and discrimination are issues that psychological research has examined extensively, particularly at the individual level of social and interpersonal dynamics. It is unquestionable that discrimination creates substantial harm. Diversity on the other hand builds our strength and empowerment. Discrimination affects many individuals and groups and diversity is a broad and complex issue. </p><p>

Although with no promises will any of the following suggested solutions will every work to solve stereotyping and discrimination.</p><p>

The following is an idea developed by University of Notre Dame for Overcoming Racial Stereotypes:<br>
“Because of their harmful effects, we should make a real commitment to try to overcome our racial stereotypes. This can be achieved by first acknowledging that we’re human and that we do harbour racial stereotypes. 
</p><p>
Next, we should work to become more aware of our inner thoughts and feelings and how they affect our beliefs and actions. When we have a stereotypical thought about a racial group, we should follow it up with an alternative thought based on factual information that discounts the stereotype. </p><p> 

We can obtain this factual information by leaving our comfort zones and exposing ourselves to people of different races. Also, we should be willing to engage in honest dialogue with others about race that at times might be difficult, risky, and uncomfortable. We should also seek out media portrayals of different races that are realistic and positive. 
</p><p>
Attending churches, plays, concerts, and movies that celebrate diversity will also broaden our world views. As we gain more awareness and knowledge about racial groups, not only will our racial stereotypes lessen, but we will also become better equipped to educate and challenge others about their racial stereotypes. 
</p><p>
As we change ourselves, we can elicit changes in others through our examples and the quality of our conversations. In doing this, we work to create a society in which all races are valued, appreciated, and embraced.”
</p><p>
Another study draws the following conclusion:<br>
“People have to be responsible for working to avoid teaching stereotypes or wrong prejudices to children. Parents and teachers, made aware of their own prejudices, may work to modify their behaviour to encourage lower levels of prejudice in children;
</p><p>
Expanding knowledge to help people learn from things that they do not understand. To do so, people will be more patient in considering their quest so that Stereotypes will be eliminated from the workplace;
Set up a clear regulation in corporation so that any action relating to discrimination or stereotypes will be fined strongly;
Media also must be responsible. They have to usually send strong educational messages to increase people acknowledged to remove discrimination and stereotypes in the workplace;
To prevent discrimination at workplace, government has made so many different laws that both employers and employees have to study such laws to protect themselves from discrimination.
To avoid a hostile work environment, people should organise a conference for both employers and employees to discuss about the topic how to prevent discrimination at workplace.
</p><p>
Concluding the above, the phenomenon of discrimination and stereotyping still exist in reality and develop into completed type. As everyone in the society performs a function, if an individual can't respect the what someone else is doing, then it's a subtle form of discrimination. We are all the same - therefore we should treat each other in the same way. This is the easiest way to eliminate discrimination and stereotypes from our society.
