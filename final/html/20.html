	The term, “person” is very ambiguous. People often use this term as a synonym for “human being”, but clearly that is not as intended. </p><p>

	Philosophical speaking, what makes someone a person is that he or she has “function”. That is, personhood means having the ability to do or function in some way. Although we often think these “functions” could be self-awareness, ability to create, feel or love, there are in fact animal kingdoms that are able to match these “functions”. Humans are persons worthy of respect by virtue of the fact that we are created human, not because of anything we do. From the zygote to the incapacitated and everything in between, human beings are persons because we "are," and we have human DNA. We do not lose our humanity or our personhood when we have diminished or absent function.</p><p>

	“What makes us persons is that we are human beings. I am a person because I am, and I am human. What makes me a person is not what I do. “I” have existed from the one-cell zygote stage. Imagining ourselves in the point of view of a zygote, we could rightfully say, “I don’t think yet, but I exist and I bear the image of God—therefore, I am.”</p><p>

	According to a article by the Consortium on Cognitive Science Instruction (CCSI), a person is the kind of entity that has the moral right to make its own life-choices, to live without (unprovoked) interference from others. 
</p><p>
	Initially speaking, what we use to distinguish persons from pets is “property. We can define a person as “any entity that has the moral right of self-determination.” Many properties have been suggested as being necessary for being a person: Intelligence, the capacity to speak a language, creativity, the ability to make moral judgments, consciousness, free will, a soul, self-awareness . . and the list could go on almost indefinitely. 
</p><p>
	“It is possible that there are aliens living on other planets that have the same cognitive abilities that we do (e.g. E.T: The Extraterrestrial or the famous "bar scene" from Star Wars). Imagine aliens that speak a language, make moral judgments, create literature and works of art, etc. Surely aliens with these properties would be "persons"--which is to say that it would be morally wrong to buy or sell them as property the way we do with dogs and cats or to otherwise use them for our own interests without taking into account the fact that they are moral agents with interests that deserve the same respect and protection that ours do.”
</p><p>
	Upon researching and review a number of websites regarding “what makes a person a person” on the internet, as well as the results from the survey conducted as shown above, here are some questions regarding what makes a person a person:
</p><p>
	<ul><li>Is it necessary to believe in humans having souls to differentiate person rom things?</li>
	<li>Does freeform in whole or in part differentiate a person from a thing?</li>
	<li>How do the affection or passions bear upon the discussion of persons and things and moral freedom?</li>
	<li>Can a human truly be apart from other individuals?</li></ul>
