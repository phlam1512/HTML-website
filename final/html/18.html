	This is a negative stereotype towards Women Drivers. Although this topic being debated for an extended period of time, many studies were conducted in the past and it has drawn very different conclusions; this stereotype originated according to the course of history and technological development. </p><p>

	When cars were first invented, women were almost universally homemakers, as men not women learnt how to drive. As time progresses and cars became more accessible, and after women gained more respect in the society, women drivers came along, but since these were new drivers, others began being wary of female drivers, and it has persisted to today.</p><p>

	Although this stereotype may just be a biased believe among the society, there are in fact a number of studies that tends to agree with this “stereotype”, or “statement”: “Researchers at the University of Michigan analysed 6.5 million car crashes in the U.S. between 1998 and 2007. Female drivers were found to be involved in 68.1 percent of all crashes, according to The Daily Mail. </p><p>

	The results are especially surprising given that men were found to drive 60 percent of the time, while women only 40 percent. In other words, women got in more accidents despite driving less than the opposite sex.</p><p>

	Lead researcher Dr. Michael Sivak said they expected to find that male-to-male crashes would account for 36.2 percent of accidents, female-to-female would make up 15.8 percent and male-to-female would make up 48 percent of collisions. Instead, analysis showed female-to-female accidents made up 20.5 percent of all crashes, much higher than expected. Male-to-male crashes were lower than expected, at 31.9 percent, while male-to-female crashes were close to their predictions at 47.6 percent.”</p><p>

	In addition, besides actual driving on the road, women were also shown to be more likely to fair their driving tests than men: “According to 2014-15 government statistics, a female 17-year-old driving test candidate was 7% less likely to be passed on her first attempt than a male candidate of the same age. </p><p>

	This figure more than doubled to 15% for those taking their first test at the age of 20, and increased to 25% at 30, 41% at 35, and 50% at the age of 50. Statistics showing pass rates at second and later attempts reflect a similar pattern.”</p><p>

	Nevertheless, there are valid counter-arguments towards this stereotype as another study suggests: “As part of the surgery by Privilege Insurance, a sample of 50 drivers faced in-car assessment while 200 were watched at Hyde Park Corner in London. </p><p>

	When marked on 14 different aspects of driving, women scored 23.6 points out of a possible 30, while men only racked up 19.8 points. On one of the categories - tailgating - just 4 per cent of women drove too close to the vehicle in front compared to 27 per cent of the men.”</p><p>
	Nearly half of men approached hazards too fast, compared with only a quarter of women, while more than half of men drove through an amber light when it was turning to red, compared to just 14 per cent of women. Only one per cent of women, but 14 per cent of men, cut into traffic dangerously, while 24 per cent of men, but only 16 per cent of women, admitted to using hand-held mobiles while at the wheel.”</p><p>

	Concluding the above, this stereotype originated due to females not being associated with cars in the past, which has led to men not believing in women drivers, as some studies show that despite women drive less than men, they ran into more accidents than men. </p><p>

	Nonetheless, there were also counter-arguments against such stereotype, but one clear fact that can be drawn from the above, is that “the research has shown that there is a really big discrepancy between how men think they drive and how they actually drive.”
