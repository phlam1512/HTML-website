	This is a negative stereotype towards White People. The phenomenon of White people being racist is something that has existed since the long past, and in particular this stereotype is being used by Americans. Since people in the United States are surrounded by messages of “White as Default”, “White as Safe”, “White as Best” starting as young children, often without our knowledge, and due to the nature of  people wanting to ascertain as quickly as possible on new individuals in their knowledge, we uses stereotype as a kind of shortcut, and are susceptible to these judgements.</p><p>

	“In a 2007 study of over 2.5 million IAT responses, University of Virginia psychology professor Brian Nosek and colleagues reported that 68% of participants demonstrated negative implicit attitudes toward black people, dark skin, and black children. A 2010 follow-up study headed by Nosek revealed that despite the US election of its first black president, little had changed.”</p><p>

	As the saying goes, “good guys ride white horses, and wear white shirts. Bad guys wear dark clothing and drive black cars. White witches are the ones you want to find in the woods. Black witches, of course, have black cats, which are bad luck. In the world of computer security, black hats are the malicious hackers and white hats are the heroes. There are white knights, black hearts, white wedding dresses, and black markets. The Christian devil is the ‘prince of darkness.’ Jesus is often depicted in robes of pure white.”</p><p>

	“Race always matters,” Hector Adames, Associate Professor of Psychology at the Chicago school told Quartz. Why is that? Chavez answers, “Race always matters because it was established as the defining feature of who was human and who was not human…Race has shaped the history of every individual who has set foot in this country.”</p><p>

	Another paper finds that white people, including police, see black children as holder and less innocent than white children, in such that Black children are more likely to be tried as adults and are given harsher sentences than white children. In addition, Black men are sentenced to far lengthier prison sentences than white men for the same crimes.
	“The odds of arrest are nearly three times higher for people who were classified by others as black, even if they did not identify themselves as black.” So an arrest makes people appear more black, and people who appear more black are more likely to get arrested.”</p><p>

	Concluding the above, the stereotype of “White People are Racist” is mainly due to the majority of the community in the United States (i.e. the White People) not being familiar with the minority of the community (i.e. the Black People), and since we want to be ascertain on these people as quick as possible, stereotypes against Black People, also known as racism emerge rapidly among the society, and has significantly impacted the entire society.
