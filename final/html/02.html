	Discrimination and Stereotyping are biased thoughts and considerations in favour of a particular group, people or individuals among the society. Discrimination and Stereotyping exists very frequently in our daily lives, and it is something that will unlikely to cease or eliminate due to various reasons, and cultural differences among the society in particular. Looking into our daily lives, there are many examples of discrimination and stereotyping. To clarify, although others often use the terms discrimination and stereotyping interchangeably as they thought that these terms share the same definition, where in fact these are very different concepts.</p>
<p>
	Firstly, stereotyping is the belief about a particular group of people or individual(s) in the society, and are often used to categorise people negatively. One example would be the bias towards genders. People often associate males to be stronger, smarter at mathematics and sciences, and females to be weaker but more delicate, as well as better at arts and humanities. Another example would be the problem of LGBT. Some people among the society having different sexual orientations and were not being recognised and respected by many others. Until nowadays, although some of these concepts start to cease as of the promotion and advocation of everyone being treated equally, these beliefs and concepts are something being set from a long time ago and will potentially never cease. </p>
<p>
	Nonetheless, these beliefs (stereotypes) contribute heavily to discrimination. Discrimination is the action that denies the right of a particular group of people or individuals based on these stereotypes. Using the previous example, from the long past there were many laws and ordinances that deny certain rights of some individuals as compared to the rest of the society. Some examples include the lack of human rights and education support, or denying and not recognising and respecting these individuals in many different aspects. Looking at the big picture, discrimination has caused many problems in the society, and in particular the inequality of different people as a certain of group among the society is being treated unequally due to these stereotyping and discriminations. </p>
<p>

	Moreover, these thoughts and concepts has hindered the full potential and ability of these people and the society as a whole, since these people were being denied and not recognised in these aspects were in fact is there were taking part, it would make a significant difference. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of stereotyping and discrimination, I will be creating a website through programming with HTML5 and CSS. A website is something that is widely accessible on the internet if it is being hosted and discoverable by others. Eventually, any websites would be visited by somebody around the world, and perhaps make an impact on their lives based on what they’ve learned from the website. 
</p>
<p>
	In conclusion, I will be creating a website in attempt to promote and advocate the idea of discrimination and stereotyping ceasing from the society through introducing many real-life examples and explain the effect and impact of discrimination and stereotyping on the so called “criminals” and “victims”, as well as the society as a whole. Moreover, this project of creating and programming a website using HTML5 and CSS, about discrimination and stereotypes, will be a great opportunity for me to not only learn more about these concepts, but also to learn and develop skills on website programming.
